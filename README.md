# Iris-dataset-PostgresSQL-ML

The task simply is to download the iris data set, build a simple machine learning model on it so that later when you insert flower dimensions in a postgres table, the model can give you a prediction and insert it along with the flower dimensions in a new postgres table.

#### In this repository, you will find:
- ready-model.py: a python script for the model.
- call-python.py: a python script that is used inside postgres to call another python script.
- predict-and-insert.py: a python script for prediction and insertion.
- The iris dataset.
- The serialized model file (in case you wanted to do a test run).
- The used postgresSQL queries.
